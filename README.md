# Colordex AKA COLOR-PICKER on GitHub

Color accessibility application created to teach myself React things.
Users are able to adjust the color for text and the background by adjusting the hue, saturation, and lightness.
Base light value should equal 0.50 to get the maximum out of the saturation and hue.

### Future Improvements

Need to fix when color values are completely white or black. Resets the values because of the package I'm using to calculate HEX values and HSL values.
